Admin Panel Project

What This Project Does

This is a simple admin panel built with React (TypeScript) for the frontend and PostgreSQL for the database. The backend runs on Render, making it easy to deploy and manage. The idea is to have a clean and easy-to-use dashboard where users can log in, manage data, and keep things organized without any hassle.  This will allow the user to make adjustments without having to code.

Features

This project lets users log in with different access levels, like Admin or regular users. Once inside, they can view a dashboard that updates in real time. Users can add, edit, and delete records as needed. The backend securely connects to PostgreSQL, so data is always in sync. The UI is styled with TailwindCSS for a modern look, and the backend is hosted on Render, so there's no need to worry about server management.

Tech Stack

The frontend is built using React (TypeScript), which makes things more structured and scalable. Styling is handled with TailwindCSS, making the UI responsive and easy to tweak. Axios takes care of API requests, and React Router makes navigation smooth.

On the backend, Node.js and Express.js handle the server-side logic, while PostgreSQL stores all the data. Prisma is used as an ORM to simplify database interactions. Authentication is done using JWT, making sure users only get access to what they should. The whole backend is deployed on Render, so itâ€™s easy to maintain and update.
